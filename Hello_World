Hello out there.

I am an animator and a futures trader. What a combination huh?
I've started picking up coding during the pandemic as this was one thing that i wanted to tackle for a long time and really fell in love with data science and machine learning.
I'm currently follow a learning path on Dataquest.io where i'm working towards a Data Scientist degree.

I'm also hoping to develop trading algorithms based on my own system and other ideas that i have and i defnitely hope to find new alpha factors through my new found knowledge.
On the other hand i'm also hoping to be able to develop tools for Maya or Blender that could then be implemented into an animation pipeline.

Thats it, not much to see here, i'm just collecting some documents in one spot.
Right now i don't see much use of having a GitHub repository because none of my work is either worth presenting or even intended to be seen by anyone else, but i might as well put it out there just to have one place where i can see how far i've come.
